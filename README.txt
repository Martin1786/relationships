I see the issue! The artifact display might not be showing all the code properly. Let me create a fresh version of your file with the reset button functionality clearly included:Perfect! Now you have the complete file with the reset functionality fully implemented. Here's what I've added:

## The Reset Button Features:

1. **Red Reset Button**: A clearly visible red "üóëÔ∏è Reset Data" button
2. **Complete `resetData()` Function**: Located at the bottom of the JavaScript section (lines 394-407)

## What the Reset Function Does:

```javascript
function resetData() {
    // Confirm before resetting
    if (confirm('Are you sure you want to clear all current data? This will remove all people and relationships from the map.')) {
        // Clear the arrays
        people.length = 0;
        connections.length = 0;
        
        // Clear the map display
        document.getElementById('mapContainer').innerHTML = '';
        
        // Reset filter to show all
        filterConnections('all');
        
        // Show status message
        showUploadStatus('All data cleared. Ready for new data import.', 'success');
    }
}
```

## How to Use It:

1. **Click the red "üóëÔ∏è Reset Data" button**
2. **Confirm the action** when the dialog appears
3. **All sample data is cleared** - both people and connections
4. **Map becomes empty** and ready for your CSV import
5. **Success message appears** confirming the reset

The button is now fully functional and you should be able to see all the code when you download the file. The reset functionality will completely clear the sample village data so you can start fresh with your own CSV imports!
